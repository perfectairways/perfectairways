    <h1> There are multiple matches for airways, including a part of the respiratory system and a designated route for aircraft: 
                                                                      Respiratory system

                                                                      Aircraft navigation
                                                                      Airways are designated routes that aircraft fly to help with navigation and separation to avoid accidents. Airways are defined by altitude blocks, corridor width, and geographic coordinates. They can be navigated using satellites or ground-based radio transmitter navigational aids. 
                                                                      Transportation

                                                                      Airlines

Secondly, airways facilitate the movement of people and goods which is essential for economic growth. Thirdly, air travel is a vital part of tourism which is a major source of income for many countries.
                                                                    <h1><br>

In its initial phase, Tata Air Services faced the challenge of inadequate facilities, operating out of a small hut with a thatched roof at the Juhu Airstrip in

Air transport allows people from different countries to cross international boundaries and travel other countries for personal, business, medical, and tourism purposes.
                                                                        You'll need at least a bachelor's degree to be eligible for the job. Of course, you'll need to know how to fly a plane, so it would help if you already have a pilot's license before starting college. They will also need to attend an FAA certified flight school for the proper training to fly commerciall
                                                                     The airway is the most important priority in the management of the severely injured patient. It is essential to open and clear the airway to allow free access of air to the distal endobronchial tree.

People need to breathe, and so do lots of other animalsâ€”and plants! Breathing is part of a process called respiration. During respiration, a living thing takes in oxygen from the air and gives out carbon dioxide.
